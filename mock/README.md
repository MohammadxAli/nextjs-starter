### Mock Server

This repository contains the code for the Mock Server. By using a mock server we can separate the development of front-end and the back-end.  

The mock server is built on top of [`json-server`](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

Each route supports all of the methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`.  
Filtering the results is available by using the [`json-server`](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) methods with query parameters.
